# FinalProject
Materials for final project in Akbar's Class

Project opened scenes successfully in VS Code, with audio playback working sometimes and other times only working after reopening a new browser window. (I believe this is related to cache settings). I have included all of the scripts, as well as the html pages. Html addresses on port used to create QR codes vis qrcodemonkey.com. However, qr codes would yield a refusal to connect. Currently adding html pages as Glitch projects to troubleshoot.



***Printed qr code is functional but audio does not play automatically.  Project 2.0 should include clickable event buttons
